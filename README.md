## ðŸ§± Project Structure

The project follows a modular dbt architecture with clear layer separation:

```
models/
â”œâ”€â”€ staging/         # Raw source cleanup and standardization
â”œâ”€â”€ intermediate/    # Unified, joined logic across sources
â”œâ”€â”€ marts/           # Dimensional models and analytical facts
â””â”€â”€ schema.yml       # Model documentation and tests
```
